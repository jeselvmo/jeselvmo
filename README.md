# Jeselvmo

A starter project that makes creating a TypeScript library extremely easy.

### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kecoyo/jeselvmo.git YOURFOLDERNAME
cd YOURFOLDERNAME

# Run npm install and write your library name when asked. That's all!
npm install
```

**Start coding!** `package.json` and entry files are already set up for you, so don't worry about linking to your main file, typings, etc. Just keep those files with the same name.

### Features

- Zero-setup. After running `npm install` things will setup for you :wink:
- **[RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/)** for multiple optimized bundles following the [standard convention](http://2ality.com/2017/04/setting-up-multi-platform-packages.html) and [Tree-shaking](https://alexjoverm.github.io/2017/03/06/Tree-shaking-with-Webpack-2-TypeScript-and-Babel/)
- Tests, coverage and interactive watch mode using **[Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/)**
- **[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)** and **[TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)** for code formatting and consistency
- **Docs automatic generation and deployment** to `gh-pages`, using **[TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/)**
- Automatic types `(*.d.ts)` file generation
- **[Travis](https://travis-ci.org)** integration and **[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)** report
- (Optional) **Automatic releases and changelog**, using [Semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), [Conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) and [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) (for the git hooks)

### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import jeselvmo from 'jeselvmo';
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `es/` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import something from 'jeselvmo/es/something';
```

### NPM scripts

- `npm t`: Run test suite
- `npm start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode
- `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
- `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
- `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
- `npm run lint`: Lints code

### Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.

#### Setup steps

Follow the console instructions to install semantic release and run it (answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?").

_Note: make sure you've setup `repository.url` in your `package.json` file_

```bash
npm install -g semantic-release-cli
semantic-release-cli setup
# IMPORTANT!! Answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?" question. It is already prepared for you :P
```

From now on, you'll need to use `npm run commit`, which is a convenient way to create conventional commits.

Automatic releases are possible thanks to [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), which publishes your code automatically on [github](https://github.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), plus generates automatically a changelog. This setup is highly influenced by [Kent C. Dodds course on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)

### FAQ

#### `Array.prototype.from`, `Promise`, `Map`... is undefined?

TypeScript or Babel only provides down-emits on syntactical features (`class`, `let`, `async/await`...), but not on functional features (`Array.prototype.find`, `Set`, `Promise`...), . For that, you need Polyfills, such as [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [`babel-polyfill`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) (which extends `core-js`).

For a library, `core-js` plays very nicely, since you can import just the polyfills you need:

```javascript
import "core-js/fn/array/find"
import "core-js/fn/string/includes"
import "core-js/fn/promise"
...
```
